It suffers from formatting inconsistencies, unclear prioritization, and a lack of focus on quantifiable achievements.  It reads like a list of activities rather than a compelling narrative of skills and experiences.\n",

            "**Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Strong academic background:** Valedictorian, high SAT/ACT scores, and attendance at MIT demonstrate academic excellence.\n",
            "* **Diverse experiences:**  The resume lists a range of activities, from leadership roles to part-time jobs, indicating a well-rounded individual.\n",
            "* **Quantifiable achievements:**  Some accomplishments are quantified, like fundraising amounts and participation percentages.\n",

            "* **Unprofessional email address:** \"Freshman@mit.edu\" is not appropriate for a job application.\n",

            "* **Outdated formatting:** The resume uses a dated style and inconsistent spacing.\n",
            "* **Lack of clear career objective:**  It's unclear what type of role the student is seeking.\n",
            "* **Unfocused content:** The resume includes irrelevant information, like detailed descriptions of Taco Bell duties.\n",
            "* **Weak action verbs:**  Many bullet points start with weak verbs like \"trained,\" \"organized,\" and \"received.\"\n",
            "* **Inconsistent tense:**  Switches between past and present tense within sections.\n",
            "* **ATS Friendliness:** Low, likely a 3/10.  The formatting issues and inconsistent use of keywords will hinder ATS parsing.\n",

            "* **Use a professional font:** Choose a standard font like Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman.\n",
            "* **Consistent spacing and margins:** Use consistent spacing between sections and maintain standard margins.\n",

            "* **Quantify accomplishments:**  Use numbers to quantify achievements whenever possible.  For example, instead of \"Oversaw staff of 14 students,\" write \"Managed a team of 14 student journalists, resulting in a 15% increase in readership.\"\n",
            "* **Use strong action verbs:** Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb that highlights the accomplishment.  Examples include:  Led, Managed, Developed, Implemented, Achieved, Analyzed, etc.\n",

            "* **Proofread carefully:** Ensure the resume is free of typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies.\n",
            "* **Get a professional email address:** Use a variation of your name.\n",
